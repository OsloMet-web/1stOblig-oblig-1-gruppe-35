    <p>My VGS was quite small, but it had a lot of charm and the environment was great. I went to Solor VGS in Flisa. It´s a small school in a rural area</p>

      I went to Nord-Troms VGS. Its the only High School in the region
      Nord-Troms. It’s a very small school with around 350 students. The school
      is very old, that was build from 1976. Both my parents went to the same
      school. The school has a the only national cross country skiing major in
      the north of Norway.
