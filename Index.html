    <h2>Problem solving</h2>
    <p>
      Complicated tasks that require problem solving. These are often tasks that
      have several approaches and solutions, then you will benefit from
      brainstorming and getting more ideas. Tasks with a large scope may require
      many working hours to be completed by the deadline, but more workers will
      reduce the workload per person and ease the responsibility of the
      individual. It is also very difficult to check your own task because you
      can quickly get tunnel vision, this applies to large tasks and
      problem-solving tasks, where it helps to get an outside perspective before
      you deliver. It is also nice to be able to work with several segments
      along the way In the larger tasks to see problems that may arise along the
      way. Will also help with the motivation factor.
