    <h2>Problem solving</h2>
    <p>
      Complicated tasks that require problem solving. These are often tasks that
      have several approaches and solutions, then you will benefit from
      brainstorming and getting more ideas. Tasks with a large scope may require
      many working hours to be completed by the deadline, but more workers will
      reduce the workload per person and ease the responsibility of the
      individual. It is also very difficult to check your own task because you
      can quickly get tunnel vision, this applies to large tasks and
      problem-solving tasks, where it helps to get an outside perspective before
      you deliver. It is also nice to be able to work with several segments
      along the way In the larger tasks to see problems that may arise along the
      way. Will also help with the motivation factor.

    <h2>Small grops</h2>
    <p>
      When working in a small group, you may come across a problem that you have
      to pass on or is someone else's work, then your work can stop and this
      then becomes a bit ineffective if you cannot work because of others. You
      don't get to work at your own pace or with your own ideas, the fact that
      you have to compromise can be ineffective compared to working alone when
      it suits you best. A bad attitude and work ethic can spill over into the
      group, this can be that someone takes up too little or too much space
      within the group and can lead to others taking a passive position.
